# Broadcast Reporting Prototype

This was a "quick and dirty" prototype for a project for Cornerstone Information Systems. This was a redesign of an existing UI that is used to schedule out delivery of reports. The project was abandoned as it was determined that the "redesign" would not involve a change in the look of the site, but only to migrate the technology used from Adobe Flash to React.

The code is rather sloppy because the project was never completed, but I do really like the design of this project.
